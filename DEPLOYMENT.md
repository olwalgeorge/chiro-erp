# üöÄ CHIRO ERP - COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Overview

This is the **SINGLE, COMPLETE** deployment solution for the Chiro ERP system. Everything you need is contained in these files:

-   `Dockerfile.consolidated` - The ONLY Dockerfile needed
-   `deploy-final.ps1` - The ONLY deployment script needed
-   `docker-compose.consolidated.yml` - The ONLY Docker Compose file needed

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Infrastructure Services (Always Required)

-   **PostgreSQL 15** - Primary database on port 5432
-   **Apache Kafka 7.4.0** - Message broker on port 9092
-   **Apache Zookeeper 7.4.0** - Kafka coordination service

### Application Services (Consolidated Microservices)

-   **core-business-service** - Core business logic and financial operations
-   **customer-relations-service** - CRM and customer management
-   **operations-management-service** - Operations and supply chain
-   **platform-services** - Shared platform utilities
-   **workforce-management-service** - HR and workforce management

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Check Current Status

```powershell
.\deploy-final.ps1 -Action status
```

### 2. Deploy Everything (Infrastructure + Applications)

```powershell
.\deploy-final.ps1 -Action full
```

### 3. Deploy Only Infrastructure

```powershell
.\deploy-final.ps1 -Action infrastructure
```

### 4. Deploy Only Applications

```powershell
.\deploy-final.ps1 -Action applications
```

### 5. Clean Up Everything

```powershell
.\deploy-final.ps1 -Action cleanup
```

## üîß Manual Commands (If Needed)

### Build Individual Service

```powershell
docker build --build-arg SERVICE_NAME=core-business-service -t chiro-erp/core-business-service -f Dockerfile.consolidated .
```

### Start Infrastructure Only

```powershell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.consolidated.yml up -d postgres kafka zookeeper
```

### Run Individual Service

```powershell
docker run -d --name chiro-erp-core-business-service --network chiro-erp_default -p 8081:8080 -e "QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/chiro_erp" chiro-erp/core-business-service
```

## üåê Access Points

After successful deployment:

-   **Database**: `localhost:5432` (user: chiro_user, password: chiro_password, db: chiro_erp)
-   **Kafka**: `localhost:9092`
-   **Application Health Checks**: `http://localhost:808X/q/health` (where X is the service port)

## üìä System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

-   **RAM**: 8GB (4GB for Docker Desktop + 4GB for services)
-   **CPU**: 4 cores
-   **Disk**: 10GB free space
-   **Docker Desktop**: Latest version with WSL2 backend

### Recommended Requirements

-   **RAM**: 16GB
-   **CPU**: 8 cores
-   **Disk**: 20GB free space

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Kotlin Compilation Fails**

    - The Dockerfile is optimized for resource constraints
    - Build uses single-threaded compilation with memory limits
    - If it still fails, try building one service at a time

2. **Out of Memory Errors**

    - Increase Docker Desktop memory allocation to 6GB+
    - Close other applications to free up RAM
    - Build services individually instead of all at once

3. **Port Conflicts**

    - Check if ports 5432, 9092, 8080-8085 are available
    - Stop other services using these ports

4. **Infrastructure Services Won't Start**
    - Run: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.consolidated.yml down -v`
    - Then restart with the deployment script

### Health Checks

Check service health:

```powershell
# Database
docker exec chiro-erp-postgres-1 pg_isready -h localhost

# Kafka
docker exec chiro-erp-kafka-1 kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Application services
curl http://localhost:8081/q/health
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy-final.ps1           # ONLY deployment script needed

```

## üéØ Deployment Strategies

### Development Deployment

-   Use `deploy-final.ps1 -Action infrastructure` first
-   Build and test services individually
-   Good for development and testing

### Production Deployment

-   Use `deploy-final.ps1 -Action full`
-   Deploys everything in the correct order
-   Includes health checks and monitoring

### Troubleshooting Deployment

-   Use `deploy-final.ps1 -Action status` to check current state
-   Use `deploy-final.ps1 -Action cleanup` to start fresh
-   Check Docker Desktop logs for detailed error information

## üîê Security Notes

-   All services run as non-root users (UID 1001)
-   Database uses dedicated user credentials (not root)
-   Alpine Linux base images for minimal attack surface
-   Health checks ensure services are responding correctly

## üìà Monitoring

### Built-in Health Endpoints

-   `/q/health` - Overall health status
-   `/q/health/ready` - Readiness probe
-   `/q/health/live` - Liveness probe

### Prometheus Metrics

Available at `/q/metrics` on each service

### Logs

View logs with:

```powershell
docker logs chiro-erp-<service-name>
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Verify all services are healthy**
2. **Test database connectivity**
3. **Verify Kafka message processing**
4. **Run integration tests**
5. **Set up monitoring and alerting**
