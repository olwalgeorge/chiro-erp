# Chiro ERP - Enhanced Comprehensive Systematic Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This improved development plan builds upon your existing foundation and provides a more structured, measurable, and iterative approach to developing the Chiro ERP system. The plan emphasizes early delivery of value, risk mitigation, and continuous feedback loops.

## Key Improvements Over Original Plan

1. **Concrete Deliverables**: Each phase now has specific, measurable outcomes
2. **Risk-First Approach**: Address highest-risk items early in each phase
3. **Value-Driven Development**: Prioritize features that deliver business value quickly
4. **Technology Validation**: Prove architectural decisions with minimal viable implementations
5. **Continuous Integration**: Build CI/CD pipeline incrementally alongside development
6. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Living documentation that evolves with the system

### Tier 3: Supporting Services (Weeks 11-12)

7. **Finance Service** - Accounting & financial reporting
8. **Billing Service** - Invoice generation & payment processing

## Development Standards

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation

```kotlin
// Example: Sales Service Domain Structure
package org.chiro.sales.domain

// Aggregate Root
class SalesOrder(
    val id: SalesOrderId,
    val customerId: CustomerId,
    val tenantId: TenantId,
    private val _items: MutableList<SalesOrderItem>
) {
    // Business logic and invariants
    fun addItem(product: Product, quantity: Quantity): Result<Unit>
    fun calculateTotal(): Money
    fun confirm(): DomainEvent
}

// Value Objects
data class SalesOrderId(val value: UUID)
data class Money(val amount: BigDecimal, val currency: Currency)

// Domain Events
data class SalesOrderConfirmedEvent(
    val orderId: SalesOrderId,
    val customerId: CustomerId,
    val tenantId: TenantId,
    val totalAmount: Money,
    val occurredAt: Instant
) : DomainEvent
```

### Event Schema Management

```yaml
# schemas/sales/SalesOrderConfirmedEvent.avsc
{
    "type": "record",
    "name": "SalesOrderConfirmedEvent",
    "namespace": "org.chiro.sales.events",
    "fields":
        [
            { "name": "orderId", "type": "string" },
            { "name": "customerId", "type": "string" },
            { "name": "tenantId", "type": "string" },
            { "name": "totalAmount", "type": "double" },
            { "name": "currency", "type": "string" },
            {
                "name": "occurredAt",
                "type": "long",
                "logicalType": "timestamp-millis",
            },
        ],
}
```

### Testing Strategy

```kotlin
// Multi-layered testing approach
class SalesServiceTest {
    // Unit Tests - Fast, isolated
    @Test
    fun `should calculate order total correctly`()

    // Integration Tests - With database
    @QuarkusTest
    @TestTransaction
    fun `should persist sales order`()

    // Contract Tests - API compatibility
    @PactConsumerTest
    fun `should publish order confirmed event`()

    // Component Tests - Service boundary
    @QuarkusIntegrationTest
    fun `should process complete order flow`()
}
```
