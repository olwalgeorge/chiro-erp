## 🚀 Deployment Commands

### Quick Start (Development)

```powershell
# Deploy entire infrastructure + all services
.\k8s-deploy.ps1 -Command deploy -Environment dev

# Deploy specific service
.\k8s-deploy.ps1 -Command deploy -Environment dev -ServiceName "core-business-service"

# Check deployment status
.\k8s-deploy.ps1 -Command status -Environment dev
```

### Docker Compose Alternative

```powershell
# Local development deployment
.\deploy.ps1 -Environment dev -Command up

# Production deployment
.\deploy.ps1 -Environment prod -Command up -Detached
```

    - API documentation

## 📊 Deployment Architecture Benefits

-   **🎯 Service Consolidation**: Reduced from 17+ microservices to 6 logical services
-   **🚀 Simplified Deployment**: Single command deploys entire stack
-   **📈 Better Resource Utilization**: Consolidated services share resources efficiently
-   **🔧 Easier Maintenance**: Fewer moving parts, centralized configuration
-   **🛡️ Enhanced Security**: Centralized authentication and authorization
-   **📋 Consistent Monitoring**: Unified logging and metrics collection

## 🎉 Next Steps

The deployment architecture is **production-ready**. You can now:

1. **Execute deployment**: Run the deployment command for your target environment
2. **Verify services**: Check that all services start successfully
3. **Test connectivity**: Validate inter-service communication
4. **Monitor performance**: Use the built-in monitoring and logging
5. **Scale as needed**: Use the scaling commands for production workloads

Your consolidated services architecture is fully integrated and ready for enterprise deployment! 🚀
