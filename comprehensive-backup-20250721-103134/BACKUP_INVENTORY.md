## Consolidation Summary

### Before Consolidation:
- 17 individual microservices
- 18 Kubernetes service manifests
- Individual Docker containers per service
- Complex inter-service communication

### After Consolidation:
- 5 monolithic services with modular architecture
- 5 Kubernetes service manifests + API Gateway
- Simplified deployment and management
- Reduced operational complexity

### Consolidated Services Mapping:
1. **core-business-service**: billing, finance, sales, inventory, procurement, manufacturing
2. **operations-management-service**: project, fleet, pos, fieldservice
3. **customer-relations-service**: crm, repair
4. **platform-services-service**: analytics, notifications
5. **workforce-management-service**: hr, user-management, tenant-management

## Restoration Instructions

If you need to restore any component:

1. **Individual Service**: Copy from original-services/{service-name}/ to services/
2. **Structure Scripts**: Copy from structure-scripts/ to project root
3. **Documentation**: Copy from obsolete-docs/ to project root
4. **Gradle Config**: Copy gradle-configs/settings.gradle.original to settings.gradle

## Migration Benefits Achieved

- ✅ Reduced deployment complexity
- ✅ Simplified service mesh configuration
- ✅ Improved resource utilization
- ✅ Easier local development setup
- ✅ Reduced operational overhead
- ✅ Maintained modularity within services
